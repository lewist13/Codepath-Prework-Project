## Codepath Prework Project

### App Description
This iOS app, developed as part of Codepath's iOS Development program, provides a user-friendly interface for inputting personal information. Utilizing Storyboard, the app allows users to easily input their full name, school name, school year, and track the number of pets they own, as well as indicate their desire for more pets.
